# TinySAConvertor

TinySAConvertor converts a csv file that the TinySA outputs into a format that Shure Wireless Workbench can understand.

The program opens with a file dialog and you can select the file you wish to convert. You will then be met with a message confirming the successful conversion and it will save over the original file.
